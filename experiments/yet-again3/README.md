# Kyumin C

Like C but with 3 features:
  * namespaces
  * reference counting
  * exceptions
  * (Built-in C-interop)

This is all I'm shooting for right now.

# TODO

* Allow lambdas to capture 'this'
* (Maybe) Allow lambdas to take mutable captures of variables
* 'auto' variable declarations (i.e. inferred type)
